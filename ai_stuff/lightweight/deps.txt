DEPENDENCIES PHILOSOPHY

Core Principle: Don’t reinvent what already exists

1. Always prefer simple, well-documented libraries over custom solutions.
     - Example: use validator.isEmail() instead of writing a custom regex.
2. Pause before building: If you find yourself writing a complex utility or framework, stop and ask: “Does a mature library already solve this?”
3. Choose proven libraries: Actively maintained, widely used, with clear docs.
4. Keep the stack lean: Every dependency adds maintenance and security overhead.
5. Favor stability over novelty: Pick stable, boring solutions unless there’s a clear reason otherwise.
