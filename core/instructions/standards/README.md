# Standards Directory

This directory contains **general-purpose coding standards** that apply universally across all programming languages, frameworks, and projects.

## What Goes Here

**Language-agnostic principles and guidelines** that every developer should follow regardless of the technology stack:

- Core development philosophy (KISS, YAGNI, DRY)
- Universal design principles (Single Responsibility, Fail Fast, etc.)
- Code structure and organization rules
- Readability and clarity requirements
- Error handling patterns
- Documentation standards

## Purpose

These standards establish the **foundation** for all code written in any language. They focus on fundamental software engineering principles that transcend specific technologies.

## File Structure

- `basic.md` - Core development standards and principles
- Additional standard files as needed for specific domains (security, performance, etc.)

## Usage

1. **New projects** - Start here to understand our coding philosophy
2. **Code reviews** - Use these as criteria for evaluating code quality
3. **Team onboarding** - Essential reading for all developers
4. **Language guides** - These standards inform language-specific style guides in `../styles/`

**Note**: For language-specific formatting and syntax guidelines, see the `../styles/` directory.
