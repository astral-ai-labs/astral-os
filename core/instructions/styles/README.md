# Styles Directory

This directory contains **language-specific coding style guides** that define formatting, syntax conventions, and implementation patterns for individual programming languages.

## What Goes Here

**Concrete style guides** for specific programming languages that translate our universal standards into actionable, language-specific practices:

- File structure and organization patterns
- Import/module organization conventions
- Naming conventions and syntax rules
- Language-specific error handling patterns
- Framework-specific patterns (React, FastAPI, etc.)
- Code formatting and documentation styles

## Purpose

These style guides provide **concrete implementation details** for how to apply our universal coding standards within specific languages and frameworks. They bridge the gap between high-level principles and day-to-day coding practices.

## File Structure

- `python.md` - Python-specific style guide
- `ts-tsx.md` - TypeScript and React/TSX style guide
- Additional language guides as needed (`go.md`, `rust.md`, etc.)

## Relationship to Standards

Each style guide **builds upon** the foundation established in `../standards/` by:
- Translating universal principles into language-specific patterns
- Providing concrete examples and code snippets
- Defining language-specific best practices
- Showing how to implement our design principles in each language

## Usage

1. **Active development** - Reference while writing code in specific languages
2. **Code reviews** - Enforce language-specific formatting and patterns
3. **IDE configuration** - Configure linters, formatters, and language servers
4. **Team consistency** - Ensure all team members follow the same language conventions

**Note**: These style guides assume familiarity with the universal principles in `../standards/`.
