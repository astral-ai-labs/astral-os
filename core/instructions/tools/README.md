# Tools Directory

This directory contains **development tool configurations and guidelines** for setting up consistent, efficient development environments across different programming languages.

## What Goes Here

**Tool-specific configurations and setup guides** that automate and enforce our coding standards:

- Package managers and dependency tools
- Linters and code formatters
- Type checkers and static analysis tools
- Testing frameworks and runners
- Build tools and CI/CD configurations
- IDE and editor configurations

## Purpose

These tool guides ensure that our coding standards are **automatically enforced** rather than manually checked. They provide the infrastructure to make following our standards effortless and consistent across all development environments.

## File Structure

- `python-tools.md` - Python ecosystem tools (uv, ruff, pytest, etc.)
- Future tool guides for other languages as needed
- Shared CI/CD configurations
- IDE/editor configuration templates

## Integration Philosophy

All tool configurations are designed to:
- **Automate** enforcement of standards from `../standards/`
- **Support** the patterns defined in `../styles/`
- **Accelerate** development workflows
- **Reduce** manual configuration overhead
- **Provide** fast feedback on code quality

## Usage

1. **Project setup** - Copy configurations to new projects
2. **Development environment** - Set up local tooling for consistent experience
3. **CI/CD pipelines** - Automate quality checks in deployment workflows
4. **Team onboarding** - Quickly get new developers up and running
5. **Tool updates** - Centralized place to update tool configurations

**Note**: These tools enforce the principles from `../standards/` and support the patterns from `../styles/`.
